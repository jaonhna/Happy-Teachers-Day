                What children are taught at an early age sticks with them for the rest of their life. They'll put everything they've learnt to good use in society. Everyone understands that today's children will become tomorrow's leaders, and teachers have the opportunity to educate these children at their most impressionable years, whether through preschool, extracurricular activities, sports, or traditional classes.
<br>
                Teachers have the power to shape future leaders in the best possible way for society to build positive and inspired future generations, and so design society on a local and global scale. Teachers, in reality, have the most important job on the planet. Those who have an impact on society's children have the ability to change lives. Not only for the sake of those children, but also for the sake of the world.
